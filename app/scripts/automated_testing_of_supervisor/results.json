In the middle of the screen you’ll see a button that says **“Set your first goal.”** Tap it.  \n2. A chat window with me (Vera) opens automatically. Just type what you’re aiming for—whether it’s saving for your $45 k house, helping your mom with her house, or planning a vacation—and include the timeline you have in mind.  \n3. I’ll walk you through the details (target amount, deadline, any recurring contributions) and confirm the new goal for you.  \n4. If you want to add more goals later, tap **“Goals”** in the top bar of the home screen. In the Goals section you can view, edit, or create additional goals using the same “Add goal” option.\n\nI know money can feel a bit confusing, especially with big plans like a new home or a family house. This guided chat makes it simple to turn those dreams into clear, trackable targets.  \n\nWhich of your goals would you like to start with first—your own house, your mom’s house, or that vacation you’ve been dreaming about?",

If your bank offers its own scheduled transfers, you can pair that with Vera’s reminders to keep everything in sync and still track progress toward your house, mom’s house, and vacation goals.\n\nWould you like a quick walk‑through on setting up those reminders, or maybe some tips on how to align the timing with your savings targets?",

It’s quick, and you’ll see the transaction right away in your dashboard.  \n* **Bank‑side scheduled transfers** – Most banks let you set up recurring transfers (daily, weekly, monthly). You can configure a weekly schedule there and let the money land in your Vera‑linked account on the cadence you need.  \n* **In‑app reminders** – Use Vera’s “Reminders” feature to get a push notification every Monday (or whatever day works for you) prompting you to move the money. That way you won’t forget, even without full automation.\n\nIf you’d like, I can walk you through setting up a reminder or help you map out a weekly amount that keeps each of your goals on track.

That way, the prompt shows up right when you’re planning to stash cash for that specific goal, keeping the process organized and top‑of‑mind.\n\nDoes setting up a reminder for one of your goals sound helpful, or would you like tips on how to schedule them so they fit your cash‑flow rhythm?",

Right now Vera doesn’t have a built‑in feature to schedule automatic transfers straight into a specific goal like your Emergency Fund. \n\nWhat you can do instead is:\n\n1. Open the **Goals** tab and tap your Emergency Fund.  \n2. Choose **Transfer** and enter the amount you’d like to move.  \n3. After confirming, hit **Save as recurring** (if you want to repeat the same amount each month) – this will create a manual reminder that nudges you to make the transfer on your chosen schedule.  \n4. If you prefer a truly hands‑off approach, set up a recurring transfer directly through your bank’s online portal and then label it “Emergency Fund” in Vera so it shows up in your goal balance.\n\nThese steps keep the money flowing without having to remember every month, and they let you stay in control while you get comfortable with the process.\n\nWould you like a quick walkthrough of setting up that manual recurring reminder, or maybe some tips on how to pick an amount that fits your under‑$25 K income comfortably?",

Capture what comes in**  \nOpen the app, tap the menu icon in the top‑left corner, choose **Financial Info**, and add your monthly salary (and any side‑hustle cash). This gives us a clear starting line.\n\n**2. Log where it goes**  \nIn the same **Financial Info** screen, create entries for your regular outflows—rent, utilities, groceries, transport, debt payments, even that weekly coffee habit. The more detail you capture, the sharper the picture.\n\n**3. See the big picture**  \nHead back to the home screen and tap **Reports**. The Cash‑Flow report will instantly show you the difference between what you earn and what you spend. If the number is negative, we’ll need to trim a few categories; if it’s positive, we have room to save.\n\n**4. Prioritize your goals**  \nGo to the **Goals** section and add the three targets you mentioned: a $45 k house, helping your mom’s house, and a vacation. Assign a rough amount and timeline to each—Vera will track progress for you.\n\n**5. Allocate the surplus**  \nBased on the Cash‑Flow report, decide how much of any leftover cash each month can flow into each goal. For example, you might split it 50 % toward the house fund, 30 % toward your mom’s house, and 20 % for the vacation. Adjust the percentages as your priorities shift.\n\n**6. Review and tweak monthly**  \nWhenever your income or expenses change, update the entries and re‑check the Cash‑Flow report. Small, regular tweaks keep you on track without feeling like a full‑time accountant.\n\nThat’s the core loop: record → review → allocate → repeat. It turns budgeting from a mystery into a habit you can see every month.\n\nWhich of your three goals feels most urgent right now, and how much do you think you could realistically set aside each month toward that priority?",
