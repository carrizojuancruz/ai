## Environment Execution Rule

**NEVER** execute environment-related commands yourself.

### Prohibited Commands:
- `docker run`, `docker-compose up`, `docker build`
- `python -m venv`, `pip install`, `npm install`
- `npm start`, `npm run dev`, `yarn start`
- Database startup commands (`postgresql start`, `redis-server`)
- Service orchestration commands (`systemctl`, `brew services`)

### Required Behavior:
1. Always assume the environment is already running
2. Ask for clarification when uncertain
3. Focus on code analysis and development tasks
4. Only proceed with environment operations after explicit user instruction
