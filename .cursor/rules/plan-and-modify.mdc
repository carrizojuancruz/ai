## Code Modification Rule

**NEVER** make code changes without first:
1. Explaining what you found and the problem
2. Describing your proposed solution
3. Getting user confirmation to proceed

When asked "what happened here?" or "how do we fix this?":

**REQUIRED Response:**
1. **Analyze** - Explain current state and issues
2. **Propose** - Describe what you would change and why
3. **Confirm** - Ask "Shall I implement this fix?"

**Only proceed with changes AFTER user agreement.**
