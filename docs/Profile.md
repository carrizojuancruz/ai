## Where Vera Gets to Know You Better

You can find your Profile under the **Profile & Memories** section in the main menu.

This is where you tell Vera a bit about yourself so she can personalize her advice and conversations just for you. When you're done, don't forget to hit **Save** at the bottom!

## Personal Info

This part is simple. Just add your name or nickname if you prefer. You do not need to include your full legal name. This helps Vera talk to you naturally.

## Vera's Approach

Here you can set how you want Vera to communicate with you. Choose the tone that fits your style, whether you like things casual, professional, or friendly. You can also list any topics you would rather skip.

## Housing and Household Info

Tell Vera about your living situation and responsibilities. This helps her understand your financial context and give more accurate guidance.

## What Would You Like to Learn About

Write about the areas you are curious about. Everything is welcome here. Make sure to include the financial topics you want help with, such as budgeting, investing, saving, or planning for retirement.

## Health Insurance

If you want to, share details about your health coverage. Vera uses this information to understand how health situations might affect your finances in the future.

## What Are Your Financial Goals

This is different from the specific goals you can set in the Goals sections.

Here you can tell Vera what are your overall objectives, such as learning about investing, build better habits or track your money more efficiently.

## A Quick Heads Up

Vera uses the information in your profile to make your experience more personal. She tailors her tips, insights, and recommendations to match your needs and communication style.

You can update your details anytime by returning to the Profile section.
